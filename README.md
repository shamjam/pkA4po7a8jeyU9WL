# VCFAD - Voice Cloning and Fake Audio Detection
Developed a machine learning system for cyber security to detect synthetically generated audio. This involved first building a voice cloning system utilizing the TIMIT dataset to convert a source speaker's voice to a target speaker's voice. Subsequently, a fake audio detection (FAD) system was developed using a subset of the CommonVoice dataset(for authentic audio) and synthetically generated audio (for fake examples). The voice cloning system was evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker classification accuracy, while the fake audio detection system was assessed using the F-score.
